# Light-Matter Interactions in Vacuum

One of my current projects has to do with investigating the ways in which light affects properties in matter at the most fundamental level! To study these properties, these interactions between light and matter will be examined both in and out of vacuum environemnts, and the perfect subject for this study is two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly tungsten disulfide (WS2). These interactions will be investigated by characterizing variations in surface potentials and photophysical responses at nanometer spatial resolution by means of atomic force microscopy and surface science techniques.

I am currently working in tandem with other physicists and engineers on this project to construct an ultra-high vacuum system to study these samples and I am excited to take this opportunity to learn new techniques and learn more about the properties of matter at the smallest physical scales!

If you are curious about this project do not hesitate to [contact me](../../contact)! I am always happy to talk about my work and exchange ideas.
