# Research Interests

I am currently working on two research projects! One is concerned with investigating [quantum fluctuations of electron and electron hole pairs](./highlights/quantum_fluc/index.md) and the other with [light-matter interactions](./highlights/light_matter/index.md). See more about my research and past research experiences below!
