Welcome! My name is Guilherme Caumo. I am a physics graduate student at McGill University interested in pursuing exciting new projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the behaviour of matter.

Currently, I am completing a masterâ€™s thesis on characterizing quantum fluctuations with the supervision of Prof. Peter Grutter. I had great experiences working with the Grutter Group during the summer of 2023 as an undergraduate researcher and I am thrilled to join it as a graduate student to try my hand at discovering new phenomena at the smallest physical scales.

For the sake of keeping this introduction concise here are some pages if you wish to learn more about me! You can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/research_index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/project_index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/about.md).

## Here is a picture of the experiment I am currently involved in:

This is an [Atomic Force Microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) that I am working on.
