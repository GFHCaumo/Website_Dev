Welcome! I am a physics researcher at McGill University interested in pursuing exciting new projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the behaviour of matter. 

Currently, I am completing a masterâ€™s thesis on characterizing quantum fluctuations. Some of the other work I am doing concerns studying light-matter interactions in vacuum. 



If you're like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/research_index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/project_index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/about.md).

## Here is an equation

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}$$

## Here is the Crab Nebula
