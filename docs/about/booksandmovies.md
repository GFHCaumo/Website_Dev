# Gui's Book and Movie Blog

## Oct. 31st, 2024
This is my first entry here, so I'll start things off by putting in a movie list for people that want something to watch in Halloween. I'm a big fan of science fiction so I'll name some classics that I think are a great watch for the horror season! Here are my suggestions:

1. [Primer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/) (2004)
2. [Twin Peaks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/) (1990)
3. [I Saw the TV Glow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15574270/) (2024)
4. [The Thing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/) (1982)

I am also currently reading [Sirens of Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan) by Kurt Vonnegut, so far I'm having a blast but it is one of his earlier works and it does show in my opinion. Honestly, I don't know why he would rename a guy with such a great name as Malachi Constant to "Unk" but it is pretty funny, even though I miss hearing the original name.
