# Introduction

My greatest interest lies in physics, and based on my studies at McGill, I have developed a range of interests drawing from projects I have completed in the fields of condensed matter and high-energy physics. My interest in physics drove me to leave my homeland of Brazil to pursue my Bachelor of Science degree in physics here in Canada, and now guides my ambitions of pursuing a master's and even doctorate degree to become an academic researcher. 

This focus marks a turning point from the research I led while in high school in Brazil, where I organized research projects in neuroscience at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul to explore the interactions between light and sleep cycles, which I later published in international journals. Although not directly related to physics, these past experiences taught me a lot about performing background research, developing scientific methodologies, data analysis, the importance of ethics in science, and presenting my work. 

In my U1 year at McGill, I expanded upon these skills while working on the construction of a radiation imager under the supervision of Prof. David Hanna, who taught me data analysis and instrumentation techniques in astroparticle physics and gamma-ray astronomy, allowing me to apply my research skills to solve new problems in a physics-based setting and present my work at Canadian Astro/Particle Summer Student Talk competition.

Based on my past research experiences, one of my current interests is condensed matter physics. Specifically, I am drawn to projects involving scanning probe microscopy applied to new and exciting systems. Therefore, the work of Prof. Peter Grutter appeals to me for its hands-on elements and broad scope. I had the privilege of working with the Grutter lab in the summer of 2023, and I worked with various aspects of instrumentation in scanning tunneling microscopes and electrochemical sensors. While there, I was able to attend weekly meetings to learn about new developments in scanning probe microscopy and learn techniques in nanoscience, mechanical design, and circuitry. Now, I am interested in pursuing new projects in this field, which has already offered me so many chances to grow as a researcher in the past. Considering this, the Grutter Group would allow me to learn about the operation of instruments directly related to one of my main scientific interests in an exciting context, and my past experiences in laboratories give me confidence in my skills to contribute to this type of work. 

Due to my interest in high-energy physics and theoretical techniques, I have pursued an honours thesis in nuclear theory with Prof. Sangyong Jeon, where I worked on hydrodynamic simulations of quark-gluon plasma. Becoming familiar with creative applications of computational methods to perform accurate simulations of physical phenomena, enabled me to become aware of new techniques to design experiments that I now seek to apply in condensed matter physics. 

More specifically, I am very interested in studying light-matter interactions with Prof. Peter Grutter to explore new properties of matter at the most fundamental level. This line of research would further motivate the development of material science techniques with improved reproducibility and better photoelectric-based technologies, such as solar cells. Therefore, I believe that working in this line of research offers ample opportunities to apply my knowledge of physics, mathematics, and coding in a field that I am also strongly passionate about with important technological implications, and in order to pursue this line of research the first step is obtaining a consistent source of funding.
