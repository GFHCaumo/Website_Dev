# Projects

Here are some projects that I have completed: 

- [Rayleigh-Benard Convection Simulation](./python_project/python_project.ipynb) I had a blast studying the hydrodynamics during my undergrad so I wrote this fluid simulation with my friends as a computational physics project.
- [Brownian Motion Simulation](./data_project/index.md) Here is a simulation for Brownian motion that I wrote, it gave me the chance to learn about new ways to incorporate physics in my code.
