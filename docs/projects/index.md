# Projects

Here are some fun projects that I have completed to learn more about physics: 

- [Rayleigh-Benard Convection Simulation](https://github.com/GFHCaumo/RBC-Project) I had a blast studying the hydrodynamics during my undergrad so I wrote this fluid simulation with my friends as a computational physics project.
