My name is Guilherme Caumo. I am a physics graduate student at McGill University interested in pursuing exciting new projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the behaviour of matter. </p> <p>Currently, I am completing a master\u2019s thesis on characterizing quantum fluctuations with the supervision of Prof. Peter Grutter. I had great experiences working with the Grutter Group during the summer of 2023 as an undergraduate researcher and I am thrilled to join it as a graduate student to try my hand at discovering new phenomena at the smallest physical scales.</p> <p>For the sake of keeping this introduction concise here are some pages if you wish to learn more about me! You can find an introduction to my research, some info on some recent projects and some more info about me.</p>"},{"location":"#here-is-a-picture-of-the-experiment-i-am-currently-involved-in","title":"Here is a picture of the experiment I am currently involved in:","text":"<p> This is an Atomic Force Microscope that I am working on.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Mr. Gui Caumo is an accomplished astrophysicist whose passion for unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos has driven her academic journey. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Physics with honors from Celestial University, where her early fascination with astrophysics blossomed. Embarking on the pursuit of advanced knowledge, she continued her education at Stellar Institute, obtaining a Master's degree in Astrophysical Sciences with a focus on high-energy astrophysics.</p> <p>Dr. Simpson's scholarly journey reached its zenith at Galactic University, where she completed her Ph.D. in Astrophysics. Her doctoral research centered on the Crab Nebula, an iconic celestial object known for its dynamic behavior. With a keen interest in both observational and theoretical aspects of astrophysics, Dr. Simpson utilized cutting-edge technology and advanced computational models to deepen our understanding of the processes at play within the Crab Nebula.</p> <p>Throughout her academic career, Dr. Simpson has contributed to numerous publications in reputable astrophysical journals and has presented her findings at international conferences. She is recognized for her meticulous research methodologies and her commitment to advancing our understanding of the universe. As a dedicated educator, Dr. Simpson has also mentored aspiring astrophysicists, fostering the next generation's curiosity and passion for the cosmos.</p> <p>Beyond the academic realm, Dr. Simpson is an avid stargazer and science communicator, regularly engaging with the public through lectures, workshops, and social media platforms. Her multifaceted approach to astrophysics encompasses both the pursuit of groundbreaking research and the dissemination of knowledge to a broader audience, embodying a commitment to bridging the gap between the mysteries of the universe and the curious minds seeking to explore them.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Cooking</li> <li>Cycling</li> <li>Olympic Fishing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/","title":"How to make Chilean-style empanadas","text":"<p>Ingredients:</p> <p>Instruction:</p>"},{"location":"about/cycling/","title":"My Cycling blog","text":"<p>I've gotten a flat tire and there's snow outside.

In a surprising turn of events, Dr. Simpson achieved a remarkable feat by securing an Olympic medal in fishing. Her passion for this age-old practice, cultivated during moments of respite from the rigors of academic research, led her to compete on the international stage. Driven by discipline, patience, and an innate connection to nature, she demonstrated an exceptional skill in the art of angling. Her Olympic success not only reflects her versatility but also serves as a testament to the notion that the pursuit of excellence transcends conventional boundaries, showcasing the multifaceted nature of an individual whose talents extend beyond the confines of a laboratory or observatory.</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>Here are some projects that I am working on. </p> <ul> <li>Python Project is an amazing python project that will allow you to see my coding skills.</li> <li>Data Project is an even more amazing project where I share data that I've used.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/data_project/","title":"Data Project","text":"<p>My research is very interesting, and the wider community is very interested in my data.
